When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm working on some projects with my teammates or whenever there is
    some code I want to reach from anyother computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Remote can include the code done by other colleagues which you may don't want
    to include/ merge in your code yet. Specialy as you as a developer know better
    when you are in alogical position to add the code at remote in your local 
    directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is when you copy one rpository into another it can on your local
    machine or from remote to local. Branches are created when you create one
    from an existing branch to track all the commits done their and to track 
    back when needed. Also branches are used to merge different features added
    in different times in different or same set of files. Forks is when you copy 
    a repository of someone on the GitHub and then clone it in your own local 
    directory.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With the help of it you can compare both your and remote state of the branch
    and see what you want to add or change.
