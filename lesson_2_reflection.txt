What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Initially a directory is not a Git repository which means Git is not
    tracking it. To be able to do it we have to run git init command to
    initialize a Git repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory is where your project is placed in your computer's file
	directory whereas repository is where all the commits (snapshots) of our 
	project i.e files are. Whereas staging area is where you place your files 
	to make a commit. For example if you want to add a commit of few selected 
	files it you ability to do that.

change?
